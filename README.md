# Kiosk 2: by the Wonderfull Group #

### What this repository includes: ###
-   Kiosk.Web: A web application. Provides a way to interact with Kiosk2 and members of the Wonderfull Group.
-   Kiosk.Core: A console application meant to serve as a springboard for further Kiosk-related projects.
-   Kiosk.Desktop: Desktop application that uses the console application as an API and uses a separate library for a lot of it's
functions.
-   Kiosk.Desktop.Lib: Library written in C++. Desktop applications use C# interop services to allow usage of this library.

### About the project: ###
-   Kiosk first started as an idea to create a network of resources that allowed skilled enthusiasts access whenever the need arose.
That idea quickly gave way to a plethora of other ideas. One of those being a way to interact with a demographic that is usually relegated to video games. Gamers. Discord seemed like the best way to make that happen, and after researching and learning of various APIs and wrappers, a project was spawned. The Kiosk Discord bot.
-   The Kiosk bot is intended to provide gamers with a useful tool to determine the depth of their competition and to provide them with useful information that will give them the edge they need to perform at their peak. 
-   Kiosk is also intended for programmers to be able to access various libraries, acting as Conan or Microsoft's VCpkg package managers.
-   In essence, Kiosk is an all-purpose program that is designed to meet the needs of many different communities and archetypes of people and usage scenarios.

### How you can contribute ###
There are a few different ways that one can contribute to this project. Some of them:
-   Code. One can provide their expertise in the form of contributing to the development of the Kiosk2 source code.
-   Build, test, feedback. One can contribute by building the applications and providing feedback about the project.
-   Spread the word. Contributing does not have to be restricting to programmers and testers. Spreading the word about the project can be just as helpful in more ways that one.

### Currently working on... ###
-   The website is currently a priority as it will provide a portal for a lot of potential users.
-   The Discord bot (Kiosk.Core) is next on that list, as it will reach another set of users.
